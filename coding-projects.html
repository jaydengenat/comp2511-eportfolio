    <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
    <p>
      These projects are simple Java programs I created while learning the basics of
      programming. They helped me understand how code works, how to think logically,
      and how to fix mistakes when something didn't run properly.
    </p>

    <h3>Project 1: Basic Java Practice Program</h3>

    <p><strong>Goal of the project:</strong><br>
      This was a small practice program where I used Java to print messages, do simple
      calculations, and experiment with variables. The main purpose was to get familiar
      with writing code, running it, and understanding how Java syntax works.
    </p>

    <p><strong>My development process:</strong><br>
      I started by writing a very basic program using <code>System.out.println</code> to print text.
      After that, I added variables and tried doing calculations with numbers. At first I got
      a few errors because I forgot semicolons, but fixing those helped me understand how
      strict Java is with syntax.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      I learned how to write simple Java statements, how variables work, and how to fix
      small errors. This project helped me get more comfortable reading error messages
      and understanding what the computer needed.

    <h3>Project 2: Workout Tracker Java Program (Practice)</h3>

    <p><strong>Goal of the project:</strong><br>
      This was a practice program I created to simulate a workout tracker. The idea was to
      ask the user for the number of workouts completed in a week, store the value, and
      then print a simple message based on their progress.
    </p>

    <p><strong>My development process:</strong><br>
      I used <code>Scanner</code> to take user input, stored the number in a variable, and added a few
      <code>if</code> statements to print different responses. I had trouble at first because I forgot to
      import the Scanner class, but after adding <code>import java.util.Scanner;</code>, the program worked.
      I also practiced running the program multiple times to test different inputs.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      This project helped me understand how user input works in Java, how to use conditional
      statements, and why testing code with different values is important. Even though the
      program was simple, it showed me how logic and user interaction fit together.
