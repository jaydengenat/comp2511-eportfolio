    <h2>Web Projects</h2>
    <p>
      These projects are small websites I built while learning HTML and CSS. They are simple,
      but they helped me understand how to structure a page, connect files, and use basic
      styling to make a layout look more organized.

    <h3>Project 1: NBA Top 5 Players Page</h3>
    <p><strong>What I was asked to do / trying to do:</strong><br>
      I created a basic webpage that listed my top five NBA players. Each player had their name,
      team, and a short description. The goal was to practice building a clean page with headings,
      paragraphs, and a simple layout.
    </p>

    <p><strong>My development process:</strong><br>
      At first, I just wrote everything in plain text, but then I organized it using different
      heading levels and sections so it was easier to read. I also added a list for the players
      and tried styling the page with CSS to center the content and adjust the spacing.
      I had a few small issues with my CSS not applying, which I later realised was because the
      file path to my CSS file was wrong. Fixing that helped me understand how linking files works.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      From this project I learned how basic HTML structure works (headings, paragraphs, lists),
      how to link a CSS file, and how to use simple properties like margins, text alignment,
      and background color. Even though the page was simple, it made HTML and CSS feel a lot
      more familiar.

    <h3>Project 2: Fitness Tips Webpage</h3>

    <p><strong>What I was trying to do:</strong><br>
      On my own time I made this project, I created a simple webpage that shared a few basic fitness tips and
      exercises. The goal of the page was to practice organizing information into clear
      sections and improving the overall layout using beginner-level HTML and CSS.
    </p>

    <p><strong>My development process:</strong><br>
      I started by planning out the sections I wanted: a short introduction, a list of tips,
      and a small section explaining why staying active is important. Once I wrote the HTML,
      I added CSS to style the headings, add spacing, and make the page look cleaner.
      I also practiced using lists to organize the fitness tips. At first, some of my CSS
      didn't apply correctly, but I realized it was because I forgot to save the file. After saving
      and refreshing, everything worked.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      This project helped me understand how useful simple HTML structures like lists and
      sections can be when organizing information. I also got more comfortable adjusting
      spacing, font sizes, and page layout with CSS. Overall, this helped me build cleaner,
      more readable pages.
