      This page includes examples of work from other courses. These assignments show my
      thinking, writing, and ability to reflect on what I learn in class.

    <h3>Assignment 1: Academic Reflection (UGST 1001)</h3>
  
    <p><strong>What the assignment was:</strong><br>
      In UGST 1001, I completed a reflection assignment where I had to describe my learning habits
      and identify areas that I wanted to improve during the semester. The purpose was to think
      about how I study, how I manage my time, and what strategies work best for me.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>My process:</strong><br>
      I started by reviewing my weekly schedule and noticing where I lost the most time.
      I also compared different study strategies like active recall, spaced repetition, and
      short review sessions. Writing the reflection helped me organize my thoughts and be more honest about what wasn’t working.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      I learned that consistency matters more than long study hours.
      I also realized that planning ahead reduces stress, and breaking work into smaller chunks
      makes it easier to stay motivated. This assignment helped me build better habits for my future classes.

    <h3>Assignment 2: Short Research Summary</h3>
  
    <p><strong>What the assignment was:</strong><br>
      For this assignment, I had to summarize a short academic article and explain its main ideas
      in my own words. The goal was to practice reading critically and understanding how to pull out
      important information from a longer text.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>My process:</strong><br>
      I read the article several times and highlighted key points. At first, it was difficult
      because there was a lot of information, but breaking it into sections helped.
      After summarizing it, I made sure everything was written in my own words and that the main
      message was clear.
    </p>
  
    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      This assignment helped me improve my reading comprehension and taught me how to identify
      the most important ideas without rewriting the whole article. It also helped my writing become
      more clear and focused.
