    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of school and programming, I have a few interests that help me grow personally
      and professionally. These areas keep me disciplined, curious, and focused on long-term
      improvement.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Investing & Financial Literacy</h3>
    <p><strong>How long I've been interested:</strong><br>
      I started learning about personal finance and investing in the past few years and have
      been gradually building my knowledge since then.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I've learned:</strong><br>
      I've focused on understanding ETFs, index funds, compound interest, and long-term
      investing strategies. I've also learned more about budgeting, financial discipline, and
      how to evaluate risk. This interest has helped me think more long-term and make more
      informed decisions with money.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Future goals:</strong><br>
      I want to continue learning about the stock market, expand into more detailed analysis,
      and eventually build a diversified portfolio that supports long-term financial stability.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h3>Fitness</h3>
    <p><strong>How long I've done it:</strong><br>
      I have been consistently training for a few years through gym workouts, mobility work,
      and general conditioning.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      Fitness taught me consistency, goal-setting, and discipline. It has also helped me
      understand the importance of balancing training intensity with recovery and nutrition.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Future goals:</strong><br>
      I want to continue improving my overall conditioning, flexibility, and lifestyle habits.
      Fitness is something I want to maintain long-term.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Strength Training</h3>
    <p><strong>How long I've done it:</strong><br>
      I have been strength training for a few years, focusing on building muscle, form, and
      functional movement.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What I learned:</strong><br>
      Strength training taught me patience, proper technique, and how to progressively overload
      safely. I've also learned a lot about biomechanics, form cues, and how small adjustments
      can improve performance.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Future goals:</strong><br>
      I want to continue increasing my strength, improving my mobility, and maintaining a balanced
      training routine that supports both performance and overall health.
